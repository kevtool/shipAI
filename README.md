#### Summary

This project uses genetic AI and Neural Networks to learn to play a variation of the Flappy Bird game, where players have to control the ship to cross pipes. It is now able to train agents to cross pipes with gaps as low as 350 pixels (although it may take a few tries). Use '''python main.py''' to run the code; it may need a few runs to achieve good results. I'm currently working on making the program more usable and generalized, and thinking of next steps with the project.
